	NOTE: This template can be used to create a working stub for a 
	new dialog on this platform.  To do so:
	
	1.  Copy this file (and its associated header file) and rename 
		them accordingly. 

	2.  Do a case sensitive global replace on the words Stub and STUB
		in both files. 

	3.  Add stubs for any required methods expected by the XP class. 
		If the build fails because you didn't do this step properly,
		you've just broken the donut rule.  

	4.	Replace this useless comment with specific instructions to 
		whoever's porting your dialog so they know what to do.
		Skipping this step may not cost you any donuts, but it's 
		rude.  

	This file should *only* be used for stubbing out platforms which 
	you don't know how to implement.  When implementing a new dialog 
	for your platform, you're probably better off starting with code
	from another working dialog.
