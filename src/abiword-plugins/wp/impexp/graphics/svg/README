The code in this directory tree may some day be adopted into the main AbiSuite
tree but at the moment it is highly experimental, even speculative, and is
therefore being developed as a plugin, and may even become an official SVG
plugin at some point.

I'm fulfilling a dream I've had for 10 years, a dream that probably every
programmer has - to write a scanline converter & graphics package. I'm working
from scratch, aided only by two trusty volumes:

[1] "Computer Graphics" Foley, van Dam, et al.
[2] "Advanced Animation and Rendering" Watt & Watt

I know I'm reinventing the wheel here. I haven't researched as rigorously as I
might, but I haven't seen any wheels out there that satisfy me.

Currently the code will not even compile, but I've added it into CVS anyway,
partly for backup and partly because some people are curious about it.
